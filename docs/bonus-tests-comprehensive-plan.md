## Test Data Requirements

### Bonus Naming Convention
Each bonus should have a descriptive name that indicates:
1. **Initial state** (Available, Active, Pending)
2. **Bonus type** (Cash-NoDeposit, Cash-Deposit, FS-NoDeposit, FS-Deposit)
3. **End state** (what it becomes after the test action)

### Wallet Validation
- **Specific amounts approach:** Validate exact wallet values before and after each financial action
- **Components to track:** Real Money, Casino Bonus, Balance (Sport Bonus ignored for these tests)

### Cross-Type Testing
Tests ensure that bonus type (Cash vs FS, Deposit vs NoDeposit) does not affect queue management logic - only the order of activation/cancellation matters.
