# Navigation Page Object â€“ Structure & Usage

In your Playwright test suite, you might have noticed the use of a `navigation.po.ts` file and wondered about its purpose. 
In this document, we'll explain the motivation behind this Navigation Page Object, how it simplifies your tests, and how 
to leverage its capabilities effectively.

---

## How Tests Look Without Navigation Page Object

Without using the Navigation Page Object, your test assertions might look scattered, repetitive, and less readable. 
For example:

```typescript
await expect(page.locator('#submit-btn')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.locator('#submit-btn')).toBeEnabled();
await page.locator('#submit-btn').click();
```

Repeated across tests, these assertions become redundant and hard to maintain.

---

## The Problem

Some common challenges when not using helpers are:

* Redundant visibility and interaction assertions across multiple test files.
* Poor readability and maintainability.
* Difficult debugging due to repetitive assertion patterns.
* Lack of consistency in handling soft and strict assertions.

---

## The Solution: Navigation Page Object

The Navigation Page Object centralizes common interactions and assertions, simplifying test readability, 
maintainability, and consistency.

### 1. Visibility Assertions

You can assert visibility with soft or strict checks easily:

```typescript
await navigation.assertVisible(element, false, 'Submit button');
await navigation.assertNotVisible(element, true, 'Hidden tooltip');
```

### 2. Enabled and Editable Assertions

Check quickly if elements are enabled or editable:

```typescript
await navigation.assertEnabled(element, false, 'Submit button');
await navigation.assertEditable(inputElement, true, 'Username field');
```

### 3. URL Assertions

Easily verify the current URL:

```typescript
await navigation.assertUrl('https://example.com/dashboard');
await navigation.assertUrlContains(['dashboard', 'userId=123']);
```

### 4. Click and Interaction Helpers

Simplify element interactions:

```typescript
await navigation.clickElement(buttonLocator, false, 'Submit button');
await navigation.fillInputField(inputLocator, 'username', false, 'Username input');
```

### 5. Attribute Assertions

Check element attributes effortlessly:

```typescript
await navigation.assertAttribute(element, 'aria-label');
```

### 6. Iteration Over Multiple Elements

Easily iterate over multiple elements:

```typescript
await navigation.iterateElements(page.locator('.list-item'), async (index) => {
    await navigation.assertVisible(page.locator('.list-item').nth(index), false, `List item ${index}`);
});
```

### 7. Conditional Clicks with Fallback

Ensure robust interactions with conditional fallback actions:

```typescript
await navigation.clickIfVisibleOrFallback(
    targetElement,
    async () => { await page.locator('#open-menu').click(); },
    false,
    'Menu item'
);
```

## `@step` and `@stepParam` Decorators

The Navigation class makes use of custom decorators to wrap assertions and interactions with readable test step names. 
This improves traceability in Playwright reports.

### `@step`
Wraps a function to log its name as a Playwright test step:

```typescript
@step('I perform login')
async login() {
  // logic
}
```

### `@stepParam`
Dynamically generates a test step name using function parameters:

```typescript
@stepParam((element, _, name) => `I expect ${name} is visible`)
async assertVisible(...) { ... }
```

This improves reporting clarity, especially when debugging failures.

---

## Using Navigation in Other Page Objects

The Navigation class is typically **injected into other Page Objects** to centralize assertion logic.

For example, in `CashierDeposit` Page Object:

```typescript
readonly navigation: Navigation;

constructor(page: Page) {
  this.page = page;
  this.navigation = new Navigation(page);
}

public async clickBackButton(softAssert = false): Promise<void> {
  await this.navigation.clickElement(this.backButton(), softAssert, 'Back button');
}
```

This allows:
* Consistent assertions across the codebase.
* Cleaner test logic (page object focuses on "what", navigation focuses on "how").
* Reusability of methods like `assertVisible`, `clickElement`, `fillInputField`, etc.

---

## Example: Putting It All Together

Here's how concise and clear a test looks using the Navigation Page Object:

```typescript
await navigation.assertVisible(loginButton, false, 'Login button');
await navigation.clickElement(loginButton, false, 'Login button');
await navigation.assertUrlContains(['dashboard', 'login=true']);
await navigation.fillInputField(searchBox, 'Playwright', false, 'Search Box');
await navigation.clickIfVisibleOrFallback(resultElement, fallbackAction, false, 'First search result');
```

---

## Conclusion

The Navigation Page Object is a powerful abstraction layer, simplifying test maintenance, readability, and reliability by:

* Centralizing common element interactions and assertions.
* Providing easy-to-use methods for both soft and strict assertions.
* Ensuring test readability and consistency across your test suites.

Use the Navigation Page Object to streamline your Playwright tests, making your codebase more maintainable and developer-friendly as it grows.
